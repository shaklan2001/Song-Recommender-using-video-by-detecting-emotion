# Song-Recommender-using-video-by-detecting-emotion-in-python
This project was developed Reuben Mark Elias and Rajat Singh, students of DTU.

In this project our main file is Videotester.py it will first open the camra of your pc and capture your face and then detect emotion using machine learning after that it will search youtube for the songs that are suitable for that emotion and then choose a random out of top 10 and show it to us.

POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS -->

1) Define a good and narrow catagory for each emotion
2) better showcase the recommended songs
3) use better test cases for emotion detection
